# Full-Stack App with React, Flask, Langchain, Vertex AI, and Gemini

This application demonstrates a modern full-stack architecture optimized for development, deployment, and AI integration.

## Frontend

- **React:** Built with React to provide a high-performance, interactive user interface.

## Backend

- **Flask:** A lightweight Python framework that provides a flexible API layer for data management and communication with the frontend.
- **Langchain:** Simplifies interactions with Vertex AI's datastore and Gemini, a powerful large language model from Google AI.

## Deployment

- **Multi-Stage Docker Build:** This build process optimizes the image size and improves deployment efficiency:
  - **Stage 1:** Builds the React frontend application.
  - **Stage 2:** Packages the Flask backend with Nginx for production-ready serving.

## Benefits

- **Clean Separation of Concerns:** Decoupling the frontend (React) and backend (Flask) simplifies development, testing, maintenance, and scaling.
- **Rapid Development:** React and Flask offer tools and frameworks that speed up the development process.
- **AI Integration:** Langchain makes it easy to integrate and interact with the Vertex AI datastore and leverage the Gemini large language model for intelligent functionality.
- **Optimized Deployment:** The multi-stage Docker build creates smaller, more efficient images, leading to faster deployments and reduced resource usage.
